This is your house. South from you is the beach access, and west from you is a path.123A beach with dull sand. Downwards there is a blue sea that stretches out to nowhere. To the west there are some branches blocking your view.123You walk along the path. If you look down you see a forest. Westwards is towards your house.123cave123There is a perfectly picturesque beach with white sand and bright blue water. Big coconut crabs scuttle across the sand. 123You splash into the sea. It is icy-cold, so you better go back up to the beach when youâ€™re finished swimming.123This hut was obviously used by old hunters before it was abandoned for some reason. Maybe there is something of use here?123After your very exhausting fight, you sit down and relax. To your surprise, a bowl of food appears before you and you gobble it down as fast as you can and then you sleep like a baby.
